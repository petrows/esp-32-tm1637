    config DELAY_BLOCKING_TIME
        int "Blocking time between clock pin changes"
        range 1 100
        default 3
        help
            This option allows you to configure the blocking time between changes
            of the clock pin in the ESP TM1637 module. The value represents the
            delay in microseconds (us) to be inserted between clock pin changes.
            Increasing the blocking time can help ensure reliable communication
            with the TM1637 module, especially in scenarios where the module may
            have difficulty keeping up with rapid clock changes. Adjust this value
            based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your
            TM1637 module hardware. The range for this option is from 1 to 100 microseconds,
            with a default value of 50 microseconds.

    config TM1637_BRIGHTNESS
        int "TM1637 LED brightness"
        range 0 7
        default 7
        help
            This option sets the init brightness level of the TM1637 LED module.
            The value should be between 0 (lowest brightness) and 7 (highest brightness).
            The default brightness value is 7 (highest brightness).
